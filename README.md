# MagSafe Charger Stand

This stand elevates your iPhone at an ergonomic angle while securely holding a MagSafe charger pad. It consists of two parts that can be assembled using two screws. For added stability, the base has an optional version with six slots for M8 bolts to increase its weight.

The stand is designed to be compatible with Apple's official MagSafe charger as well as similar-sized clones. Because these chargers can vary slightly in size, two versions of the top part are included: one for Apple's 56mm charger and another for slightly larger clones. You can also modify the source code, available on GitHub, to accommodate other charger sizes.

## Hardware Required
- 2 x 2.9 x 9.5 mm self-tapping screws (DIN 7982C)
- 6 x M8 nuts (optional, for additional weight)

## Printing & Assembly Instructions
1. **Print both parts**: the base and the top. For better stability, use a dense infill when printing the base.
2. **Optional weight**: If you're adding M8 bolts for extra weight, thread them into the dedicated slots at the bottom of the base.
3. **Cable threading**: Feed the USB-C end of the charger cable through the top part of the stand, routing it down and out through the bottom.
4. **Inserting the MagSafe charger**: Press the charger pad into the top part with its front side facing inwards. The top has three lips designed to hold the charger securely. Itâ€™s a tight fit, so you may need to flex the part slightly until the charger snaps into place.
5. **Final assembly**: Fasten the top and base parts together by inserting and tightening the two screws.
6. **Cable management**: Tuck the charger cable into the channel on the bottom of the base to keep everything tidy.
